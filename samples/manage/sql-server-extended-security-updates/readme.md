# SQL Server 2008/2008R2 Extended Security Updates
If you’re running SQL Server 2008 or 2008 R2, these versions are reaching the end of their support lifecycle on July 9, 2019.      
Each version is backed by a minimum of 10 years of support (5 years for Mainstream Support and 5 years for Extended Support) including regular security updates.      
End of support means the end of security updates, which can cause security and compliance issues and put applications and business at risk.      
We recommend upgrading to current versions for the most advanced security, performance, and innovation.      
For customers that can’t get it all upgraded by the deadline, new options help protect applications and data during the upgrade transition:     
-  Migrate your existing SQL Server 2008 and 2008R2 workloads as-is to Azure and receive additional 3 years of free Extended Security Updates (if and when available)
-  Purchase Extended Security Updates for your servers and remain protected for up to 3 years until you are ready to upgrade to a newer SQL Server version
